ISSUES:- 
1) At first I got the display for all the data sets i.e. buildings,photos and photographs. But accidentally all the data entries got deleted.
I don't have any clue how did it happen. But when I reinserted the same entries again the buiding table shows all the entries when I run
 the command "select * from buiding;" but when I try to retrieve only the coordinates it is giving error subscript out of count and is unable
to store all the values.May be its happening because I had made many tables in the metadat and was unable to delete the data from the metadata.
2) Due to this reason the buiding picture is showing some wierd behavioural features.I had run the same code many a times before the deletion of
the entries and it was running perfectly but unfortunately it is giving errors.And due to this it is giving errors in all the queries.
I tried to debug the code but I dint find any errors.But for photos as well as photographers I am getting the display.So I do not thing tthere are
any errors in the code.I tried many a times to get rid of these exceptions but I failed.
It just gave index out of bound exception when I ran my GUI under the buiding checkbox. I request our respectable professor as well as the
grader to understand the situation and not to cut any points as penalties for it as I have put in extreme effort behind this project and unfortunately
 I do not want to loose any points for this small issue. I would be very grateful if my request would be honoured.
 3)I had initially used POPULATE.java to insert queries in my tables and later since I had to read from the files directly I had to create populate.java
file.Please refer to both the java files.



Name of my tables are Buildings,PHTOI,PHOTOGRAPHERI
